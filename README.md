# WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC SOURCE CODE OF FRIDAY NIGHT JAMMIN!!
a Cartoon Friday Night Funkin' Fan-Game featuring multiple TV Shows.
Idk why I did this but I was bored.

Previously in Online Sequencer but it's overrated as fuck, so I decided that it was a good idea to put my stuff in FL Studio Instead.

[THE FLPS ARE AVAILABLE!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6aiARHRhfc)
